# sql_retail_sales_project
This is my first SQL project focused on analyzing and managing retail sales data. The project simulates a basic retail environment with tables for products, customers, sales transactions, and employees. The goal is to understand core SQL concepts such as data modeling, querying, aggregation, and reporting.
